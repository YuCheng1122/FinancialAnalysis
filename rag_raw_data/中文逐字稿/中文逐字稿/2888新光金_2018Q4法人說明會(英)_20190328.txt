SKFH recorded and consolidated after tax profits of $10.48 billion for 2018.
Earnings per share was $0.89 and book value per share at the end of the 4th Quarter was
$11.8.
Core business of each subsidiary remained solid in 2018, which will be discussed later
in the presentation.
I would also like to add that the capital adequacy ratios of the group and the subsidiaries
were all above regulatory requirements.
At the end of 2018, Group CAR was 113.7%, RBC of XinKong Life was 227.4%, BIS of XinKong
Bank was 14.4%, and BIS of Masterlink Securities was 392%.
Page 10.
Driven by strong demand in the 4th Quarter, FYP for the whole year reached $126.66 billion,
securing a market share of 9.2%.
XinKong Life has been actively promoting foreign currency policies and protection products
to contain the hedging cost, facilitate ALM matching, and grow value of new business.
FYP of foreign currency policies for 2018 increased 37.5% year-on-year to $71.55 billion,
accounting for 56.5% of total FYP.
With sufficient inflows of policy premium, cost of liabilities decreased another 5 business
points in the 4th Quarter to 4.08%, better than our yearly target.
VNB also grew more than 6% year-on-year.
In 2019, XinKong Life will continuously place its focus on foreign currency policies and
protection products to control hedging cost and enhance VNB.
FYP for foreign currency policies is targeted to increase 10%.
Total FYP will be over $100 billion and cost of liabilities will be 5 to 9 business points
lower than 2018.
Page 14 presents the overall view of XinKong Life's investment portfolio.
With higher capital gains and recurring income, in 2018 investment return increased 7 business
points to 3.99%.
Breakdown of investment returns for each asset class were real estate 1.7%, mortgage and
corporate loans 1.8%, policy loans 5.8%, overseas investment 3.6%, domestic securities 7.0%.
Page 15 presents the portfolio of overseas fixed incomes.
At the end of 2018, overseas fixed incomes amounted to $1.72 trillion.
Corporate bonds accounted for the largest share, representing 45.5% of the total, followed
by international bonds at 31.7% and government bonds at 21.5%.
Overall, distribution was similar to the previous quarter and the average yield before hedging
of overseas fixed incomes was around 4.7%.
The chart on the upper right corner displays the overseas fixed incomes portfolio by regions.
XinKong Life remained focused on North America and Europe as its key investment areas.
The share of Asia and other was 39.4% and the funds were deployed in high-yielding government
and corporate bonds denominated in U.S. dollar with superior credit quality.
Page 17, due to sharp fluctuations in foreign exchange and higher cost for traditional hedging
instruments, hedging cost for 2018 was 1.72%.
Foreign currency volatility reserve was $4.73 billion at year-end.
Hedging ratio was 82.7%, including CSNDF and the naturally hedged Forex Policies position.
In order to contain hedging cost, XinKong Life will ramp up sales of foreign currency
policies this year and the share is expected to exceed 70% of total FYP.
XinKong Life will look to increase the balance of foreign volatility reserve according to
regulations changes.
At the end of February this year, the balance of foreign volatility reserve already reached
$7.29 billion.
I will now hand over to Isabella, who will take you through the results of XinKong Bank
and Masterlink Securities.
Thank you, Stan.
Please turn to page 22.
XinKong Bank sustained its growth momentum with net interest income increasing 5.7% year-on-year
to $11.82 billion.
As the TRF losses were fully provisioned in 2017,
the provision expense for 2018 decreased 36.2% year-on-year.
Consolidated after-tax profits reached $5.22 billion, up 28.5% from a year earlier.
Page 23.
Total loan balance grew 6% year-on-year to $567.07 billion, which was in line with the
company's guidance.
Loan lending maintained an upward trend with mortgage and unsecured loans increasing 8.3%
and 6.7% year-on-year, respectively.
As for corporate lending, XinKong Bank has concentrated its efforts on overseas syndicated
loans with an existing loan book totaling $24.92 billion, which was up 43.4% year-on-year.
Loan growth target for 2019 will be 6%.
Page 24.
Due to higher U.S. dollar funding costs, both net interest margin and net interest rate
for the whole year came down to 1.54% and 1.94%, respectively.
Given the fierce competition in the loan market and the limited room for further rate hike,
it will be challenging for the bank to maintain net interest margin and net interest rate
at the level of 2018.
Page 26.
Wealth management income for 2018 grew 5.4% year-on-year to $2.16 billion, with strong
sales momentum in bank insurance, which accounted for 50.6% of total wealth management income.
This year, XinKong Bank will offer deposits with preferential interest rates to attract
new funds and cultivate clients with AUM over $3 million.
On the product side, foreign currency policies and regular paid products will be the sales
focus.
The growth target for wealth management income in 2019 is double digits.
Page 27.
Asset quality was stable with NPL ratio at 0.23% and coverage ratio at 570.15%.
The new NPL generated in the fourth quarter was $672 million, and this money came from
an individual case which accounted for $464 million.
However, this case was fully provisioned at the beginning of 2018 and was written off
at year-end.
Page 30.
Master Link Securities recorded an after-tax profit of $0.83 billion for 2018.
The revenue from brokerage business grew 10% year-on-year to $3.37 billion, accounting
for 66.2% of the total revenue.
Brokerage market share was 3.78%, with a ranking of top 6 in the industry.
In 2019, in order to sustain growth in the brokerage and wealth management business,
Master Link plans to upgrade its intelligent stock picking system and launch robo-advisor
services.
The company will also recruit brokers with financial planner certificates to enhance
overall productivity.
As for underwriting business, Master Link will leverage the group's resources to build
a pre-IPO position and earn SPO deals.
So this is the end of our result presentation.

And I believe that in this year, we pretty much moved in tandem with the others, that
the hedging ratio would be actually relatively lower than last year.
So fully hedged will be around somewhere around 60 percent, and not much different from last
year.
Thank you, James.
And the second question is, on February, average reserve increased by around $2.5 billion compared
to what we had at the end of last year, increased to $7.3 billion, which is not that far away
from what I have mentioned, $10 billion.
However, given that the dialogue between insurance companies and also regulators is still ongoing,
we're not sure whether the reclassifications for any of the reserves will be available.
However, we will continuously working very hard on remand.
Our FF hedging strategy is very flexible, as James has just shared with you.
We can increase that $2.5 billion, not because of any reclassifications of the special reserves,
but because we have gained some money from the unhedged positions and proxies hedging
positions.
That's the only reason why we can increase it.
So we have to remand quite flexible.
I will say there is a chance, I cannot guarantee, but there is a chance that we can miss the
target we gave it to you before.
And also for the banking, to ask about a few guidance, I will say for loan growth, 2019
still targeting at 6 percent.
And for wealth management fee growth, we would like to see 10 percent or above growth, although
we guided the market that 2018 we would like to see double-digit, however, for the rest
of the year, and we've seen a growth rate around 5.4 percent.
And this year, we are going to focus more on the clients who have assets higher than
3 million NTs.
We are also going to have some preferential deposits programs to allure more possible
AUMs from our clients.
And for credit cost, if we define that by the reserve expenses over the averaged loan
size we had, last year, 2018, the number was 0.3 percent, about 30 basis points.
A couple of years ago, I said that it cannot remain as low as 0.2 or even lower than 0.2.
It will be going slightly higher.
And last year, what we had is pretty much in line with the guidance.
2019, our view is that it could be at a similar level and even have a chance to have a slightly
decrease in the provisions, but I don't think the change will be very significant.
So, still around that level and maybe slightly improved.
And for RBC ratios, you are exactly right that a few of our competitors, friendly competitors,
of course, they are planning to have some capital injections to life insurance.
And in hindsight of what we had last year, we did see net worths to decrease quite significantly
in the first quarter.
But the good news is that in the first quarter, of course, it's not at the end yet, but so
far we have seen unrealized losses from the financial instruments that we invested, classified
in the overlays or in OCIs, originally give us a loss as high as $19.5 billion as of the
end of 2018.
Now, the number is already positive.
So, I've seen significant improve.
And also from the AC's perspective, from those amortized costs, no need to be multi-market
to shareholders' equity, we have seen significant loss last year, but now it's also quite approaching
to a breaking even.
So, very encouraging.
Overall, AC plus the OCI's overlays positions, we have seen improvements over $110 billion
NT so far, starting from the beginning of the year.
As for dividend policies you mentioned, we are going to distribute the cash.
If we define it very, very clearly, those may not be dividends, but from our capitals
accumulated before.
And the amount is quite, I would say, modest.
It's not a huge amount.
It's roughly $0.2 per share in total amounts around $2.4 billion NT.
The distribution will not harm the group's CAR too significantly.
Do we want to increase the capitals, inject the capitals into our life insurance?
There is a potential.
And you can also read from our announcements that there is a likelihood, there's a mandate
that we would like to plead the AGMs to give us a flexibility to raise from GDRs, placements,
including the preferred shares, in total amounts not exceeding $10 billion NT this year.
If there's any need, we believe, because we have no preferred shares outstanding and there
has been a few years that we haven't had any significant placement, private offerings.
I think the chance for us to pull it through is very, very solid.
It's very, very solid.
If there's any need from our subsidiary, particularly the life insurance subsidiary, we will have
the ability to downstream the capital.
The point for us to be able to offer your clients and our investors some of the cash
is because we need to remain our attractiveness in the capital market.
We are a financial holding company, at least we have to provide some of the cash flows
to our long-term shareholders and we would love to see those long-term shareholders to
stay with Xinkong and to support our further needs in the capital market, if there's any.
Yeah, maybe I have two follow-up questions.
First one is on the RBG ratio.
So what's your guidance on the targets?
Do you still want to maintain above 250% or you are fine if you stay below 250% for maybe
a couple of reporting periods?
The second question is regarding the potential fundraising, sorry, I probably missed that,
but are you considering issue the preferred equity as well?
And then because recently our understanding is financial regulators probably no longer
prefer the financial holding company to issue preferred equity.
So just try to get a sense of how your interpretation on that.
Thanks.
Jamie, as for RBCs, we will definitely remain above regulatory requirements, however, given
the volatilities in the market, I have seen that already now below, slightly below 230.
I wouldn't say that 250 is the floor that will remain to be our policy.
We have to remain flexible, but as I mentioned, there are ways for us to increase our capital.
The most efficient way may not be only referring to capital raising, but what I mentioned to
you, the rebonds from the market, if we seize opportunity, our investment team did their
job well in the first quarter, and we have seen, not including the ACs, ACs not in the
shareholder equity, those including in the market for the shareholder equity has a rebond
now more than $20 billion, and that's the thing we want to do.
And you also asked about whether there's a chance for us to offer preferred shares.
My answer is yes, there's a chance.
And I do not believe regulators have any clear rule to stop us from offering preferred shares.
Preferred shares is a very feasible, say, capital raising instruments for us.
I do believe what they want us to do is not to let the subsidiaries, particularly the
life insurance, to raise any hybrid capitals from the market.
They would love to see the insurance companies to have some injections, if any, from the
common equities.
Those will be from the holding company.
The preferred shares, which is likely, are even not approved by the agent yet.
I cannot be very, very confirming your answer, but I can say that if there's a chance that
we offer preferred shares, those will be the preferred shares that will have a feature
without any cumulative dividends.
That means those will be as senior as common equities that will give us a chance to downstream
the capital into the life insurance, and as legitimate as the common equities.
Yep, understood. Thanks.

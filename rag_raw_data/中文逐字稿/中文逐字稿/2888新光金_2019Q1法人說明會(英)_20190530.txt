Core business of each subsidiary remained stable in the first quarter,
which will be covered later in the presentation.
Page 10.
Due to adjustments in product mix, FYP for the first quarter grew 13.2% year-on-year
to $30.27 billion, securing a market share of 7.8%.
XinKong Life has adopted a value-oriented product strategy
and promoted foreign currency policies to protection products to contain the hedging cost,
facilitate ALM matching, and grow value of new business.
FYP of foreign currency policies for the first quarter grew 6.5% year-on-year to $16.26 billion,
and sales of protection products increased 24.6% year-on-year to $1.67 billion.
With sufficient inflows of policy premium, annualized cost of liabilities declined 2 basis points to 4.06%,
in line with our guidance.
Page 14 presents the overall view of XinKong Life's investment portfolio.
Annualized investment return for the first quarter 2019 reached 3.68%,
thanks to one-off disposal gains of equities and bonds and higher recurring income.
Breakdown of investment returns for different asset classes were
Real Estate 3.2%
Mortgage and Corporate Loans 1.8%
Policy Loans 5.6%
Overseas Investment 4.3%
Domestic Securities 2.6%
and Cash 0.6%.
Page 15 presents the portfolio of Overseas Fixed Incomes.
At the end of the first quarter, Overseas Fixed Incomes amounted to $1.74 trillion.
Corporate Bonds accounted for the largest share, representing 45.9% of the total,
followed by International Bonds at 31.5%,
and Merchant Market Government Bonds accounted for 21.6% at quarter end.
You may see the chart of the Overseas Fixed Incomes portfolio by region on the upper right corner.
There was no significant change in the first quarter.
Shenkong Life remained focused on North America and Europe as key investment areas.
Page 17, the pie chart on the left-hand side shows the mix of hedging instruments.
At the end of the first quarter, hedging ratio was 74.9%,
including CS, NDFs, and naturally hedged foreign currency policies.
Annualized hedging cost for the first quarter was 1.59%,
and foreign currency volatility reserve increased $2.3 billion quarter-on-quarter to $7.0 billion.
Also, as of the latest update, the reserve exceeded $10 billion,
and NTD continued to lose ground against the U.S. dollar.

Shenkong Bank generated a pre-provision profit of $1.81 billion for the first quarter,
up 1.1% year-on-year.
Consolidated after-tax profit was $1.19 billion,
at a similar level of the same period last year.

Corporate lending remained in an upward trend with a year-to-date growth rate of 3.1%.
Domestic large corporate loans and overseas syndicated loans were the fastest-growing segments,
rising by 7% and 8.6% respectively.
Total loan balance rose 1.5% year-to-date to $575.43 billion,
and the loan growth target for 2019 remains at 6%.
Page 24.
As more deposits were retained to facilitate business growth,
loan-to-deposit ratio for the first quarter decreased from 75.6% to 74.5%.
Both net interest margin and net interest rate for the first quarter
came down to 1.49% and 1.86% respectively.
Given the fierce competition in the loan market,
it will be challenging for the bank to maintain its net interest margin
and net interest rate at the level of 2018.

Wealth management income grew 2.9% year-on-year to $560 million.
Thanks to a strong growth sales momentum in bank insurance,
which accounted for 55.9% of total wealth management income.
For the second half of the year,
Shenkong Bank will offer deposits with preferential interest rates
to attract new funds and expand its client base.
On the product side, foreign currency policies and regular paid products
will remain the sales focus.
The growth target for wealth management income in 2019 is double digits.

mass-linked securities recorded an after-tax profit of $0.48 billion,
up 28% year-on-year.
Brokerage market share was 3.56%

VNB increased from $23 billion to $24.1 billion in 2018.

Compared to the high base of 2016, FYP for 2017 declined 3.4% year-on-year to $110.96
billion, representing a market share of 8.8%.
Besides, Xinkong Life chose not to promote investment-linked products.
However, foreign currency policies remained market-focused in 2017, and FYP of such policies
increased 118.9% year-on-year to $52.04 billion, accounting for 46.9% of the total.
With sufficient inflows of saving policies, cost of liabilities improved 14 basis points
to 4.23% in 2017, better than our expectation.
Going forward, Xinkong Life will actively promote foreign currency policies and protection
products to facilitate ALM matching and VNB growth.
Page 13 presents an overall view of Xinkong Life's investment portfolio.
Investment return for 2017 was 3.92%, 12 basis points higher compared to 2016.
Breakdown of investment returns for different asset classes were real estate 3.1%, mortgage
and corporate loans 2.1%, policy loans 5.8%, overseas investments 4.2%, domestic securities
3.5%, and cash 0.5%.
Page 14 shows the portfolio of overseas fixed incomes.
At the end of 2017, corporate bonds accounted for the largest share, representing 46.6%
of the total, followed by international bonds at 28.9%.
Emerging market government bonds grew from 20.3% in 2016 to 22.6% in 2017.
The chart on the upper right displays overseas fixed incomes portfolio by regions.
Xinkong Life invested more funds in North America during 2017, with eyes on the rising
bond yields and superior credit quality.
Thus, the share of North America increased to 34.2%, while that of Europe declined to
27.0%.
The share of Asia and others slightly went up to 38.8%.
Page 16, hedging cost for 2017 was 1.55%, and foreign currency volatility reserve increased
$2.55 billion at year end.
Hedging ratio was 83.2%, including CS, NDS, and natural hedge forex policy positions.
CS and NDS accounted for 60% and 40%, respectively, of traditional hedges.
In order to better control hedging costs, Xinkong Life will continue to promote sales
of foreign currency policies in 2018.
I will now hand over to Isabella, who will take you through the results of Xinkong Bank.
Thank you, Sven.

Xinkong Bank posted a consolidated after-tax profit of $4.06 billion for 2017, 12.3% lower
compared to 2017.
This decline was mainly attributed to the increased provision expense, which grew 83.8%
year-on-year.
However, the provision expense is expected to normalize in 2018, as the remaining TRF
positions were completely settled in August 2017.
Page 24, the loan balance of the end of 2017 went up 5.2% year-on-year to $534.82 billion.
Loan growth was driven by consumer lending, which grew 9.8% year-on-year.
Over the past quarters, Xinkong Bank has been extending its overseas lending operations
to maintain a stable interest rate.
As of the end of 2017, the overseas syndicated loan balance reached $17.37 billion, indicating
an annual growth rate of 92.4%.
Going forward, the bank will continue to expand its overseas client base and build
up close relations with key partners to enlarge its offshore earnings.
Page 25, the full-year net interest margin and net interest rate were 1.57% and 1.96%,
respectively, which was in line with our guidance.
As for 2018, given the higher loan growth targets and likely no further decrease in
the funding cost, net interest margin and net interest rate are expected to be slightly
lower than the level in 2017.
Page 27, wealth management income for 2017 grew 3.7% year-on-year to $2.05 billion, with
strong sales momentum in mutual funds and overseas securities.
The fee income from these two categories accounted for 45.5% of the total.
This year, Xinkong Bank will continue to recruit experienced financial consultants and enhance
average productivity.
On the product side, foreign currency policies will be the sales focus.
The growth target for wealth management income in 2018 remains double digits.
Page 28, asset quality remains stable with NPL ratio at 0.24% and coverage ratio at 488.29%.
New NPL generated in the fourth quarter was $300 million, down by $151 million compared
to the previous quarter.
So that wraps up our result presentation.

Now, please press 01 if you would like to ask a question.
Thank you.
Before we start taking questions, I would like to take this chance to briefly talk about
one page that we talked about the adoptions for.
If you may turn to page 18, on your left-hand side, you see that the statutory value for
the end of last year was $90.8 billion.
As of the first date of 2018, you can see that there was incremental proportions on
the very top of the bar chart, $19.4 billion, increased mainly from the mark-to-market for
the FVOCI.
If you take a chance to take a look at the chart on your right-hand side, you can see
that originally we have about 80%, 80% classified as no active market and hold to maturity.
Don't have to be mark-to-market.
As a result of reclassification, on your right-hand side, you can see that the NAM, HTM position
combined has decreased to 63.1%, roughly 17, 17% decrease.
The new classification is named as the portion largely goes into the FVOCIs.
You can see that the VPL overlays mainly classified with positions and the VOCIs mainly
classified for the bond positions combined accounted for 34%, which is significantly
higher than what we had as a level of self at the end of last year.
You don't have to worry about the future fluctuations for the fixed incomes.
It is because, thanks to the investment team, particularly to James Yuan, we have been very
actively managing the portfolios and the OCI fixed income in the first two months of 2018.
The position has been decreased significantly.
If you take a look at today's number, you will see the amortized cost, the AC position,
went back up to higher than 69%.
It will soon be higher than 70%.
And the decreased portion is mainly from the bonds.
Some of the positions has been disposed for those equities positions with unrealized loss.
As a result of the management, if you take a look at our balance sheet, as for the end
of February, you will see the unrealized losses for the financial assets has been erased.
We have a positive unrealized gains as of the end of that.
This is the essence about the reclassification.
If you have further questions, please feel free to ask.

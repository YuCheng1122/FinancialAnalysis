Ladies and gentlemen
We will now begin our question and answer session
If you wish to ask a question
Please press 01 on your telephone keypad
And you will enter the queue
After you are announced
Please ask your question
And should you wish to cancel your question
You may press 02
Thank you
And the first question is from
Chong from Credit Suisse
Go ahead please
Hi Stan
Thanks for the presentation
I have three questions
My first question is
On your recurring yield
Just want to get a sense
With interest rate still quite depressed
As well as it is now
Do you have any pressure
To maintain your recurring yield
At around 3.9%
I think Stan you also mentioned
If I hear it correct
That your overseas fixed income
Year blended average is 4.8%
Or 4.9% pre-hedge
Just want to know if
What is the new money
That you are deploying
Into overseas fixed income
What type of yield are you getting now
Are you still able to get 4.9%
Or 4.8% pre-hedge
And also if you can give us some color
On the investment
The credit rating breakdown
Of your overseas portfolio
That will be helpful
My second question is on VNB
I think the first half VNB was up
Double digit year over year
If I remember correct
I think for the first nine months
It is flat
So just want to know if
I think previously management guidance
Is flat VNB year over year
I just want to know
If that is still your guidance for this year
And lastly just on the bank side
The provision and asset quality
Notice your provision is up quite a bit this year
1.6 billion
But your NPL and coverage ratio is quite steady
I think that kind of implies
Quite a significant amount of charge off
Just wondering if you have the number
And how much of that
Is collateralized
We should expect some buybacks
Sometime next year
Thank you
Sean thank you for the questions
For the first question
Regarding to recurring yield
Our recurring yield is targeted at
Higher than the last year's
Whole year's number
That's our current expectations for 2017
Well having said that
It's not an easy job
As a global yield as you mentioned
New money may not be as high
As 4.85 before hedge
May not be
And I'll leave that to James later
The point here is that
We are increasing the high dividend yield
To market stocks
Sure
If you look at the first nine months
Our overseas fixed yield is about 4.83
And the new money coming in
For the first nine months
Is exactly the 4.83%
And meanwhile
If you are looking at October number
Or the November current number
Is roughly 4.5%
North of that
Secondly you asked about the BNB
So how much can you
For BNB the FYP target
For this year is 100 billion
I think we'll achieve that
Because there are still two months
So we're not sure
If we can achieve the number
As we did last year
If we have fewer premiums
Than last year
We have said that
Our BNB might remain the same
Because we have a better product mix
This year
Especially for foreign currency product
Which gave us a higher margin on the BNB
So if we have fewer FYP than last year
But the BNB might remain the same
But if we can achieve
The same FYP as last year
We might have some
Single digit growth on the BNB
And Sean the BNB
Result delivered so far
With the same set of actual
Aerial assumption
Is in line with our guidance
Okay
All right
Last question is regarding
The bank's provisions and asset qualities
Let me briefly talk about it
And then if there's anything
That our president of the bank
May add on I will let him do so
First of all
The provision is higher than last year
Our guidance that the whole year
Provisioning number will be
About 1 billion higher
Compared to last year
Most of the provisions
Still goes for the loans
Not the TMUs
TMUs will account for
About 1 billion
For the whole year
1 billion
Again our TMUs
TRS positions
Already been settled
As of the end of August
No new positions
Still we have to closely watch
How our clients
Are and will
Honoring their negotiated
Credit charges
And also
Secondly if I may talk about
About the NPR ratios
And contributions
This year's charge off number
Was quite similar to last year
First 9 months
Charge off about 1.22 billion
Of our loans
Last year
The first 9 months
Slightly higher
About 1.25
Similar numbers
What is different
Is that this year we
Don't want to further lower
The NPRs and the coverage
We want to increase both ratios
Remain both ratios
Higher than the industry level
Charles do you have anything to add
Just like what Stan said
We most of our provision this year
For the regular loans
And for the TMU or TIF transactions
Actually we have already
Reserved the
We believe sufficient provision
For those transactions
Okay
Okay thank you
Thank you sir
And now as a reminder
Please press 01 on your keypad
If you would like to ask a question
Thank you
We are now in question and answer session
If you would like to ask a question
Please press 01 on your telephone keypad
Thank you
And the next question is coming from
Anthony Lam from HSBC
Go ahead please
Hi thank you for this donation
It's me again I mean
I have a few questions
The Chinese question
I think that's very important for a lot of us
I think there have been quite a few questions
Around the equity position
Domestic power market
But I think the more important question
Behind those
Probably is the
Investment management process
Or risk management
I think there's often a slide
At the back of the live session
Talking about risk management
But I think
Could you help us understand a bit more
What's been changed
Compared with two years ago
When you suffered quite a bit
On the equity position
And what additional
Risk management measures
Have you put in place
Apart from the VAR
Or I mean more stringent
Investment process
Along with the SAA or TAA targets
Thanks
Well in terms of
The domestic equity investment
The investment process
Has changed a bit
In terms of the revenue generation
For the live insurance company
So in the past
80% of the revenue
Generated from the domestic equity
Will be from capital gain
And 20% from dividends
Now it's from last year
That we changed it to
80% from dividends
And 20% from capital gain
So that would help us
To reduce the transaction volume
And reduce the turnover
And give us a better timing
In terms of transacting
The domestic equity
So that's why we were able to
Produce domestic and foreign
Close to 10 billion of dividend income
And roughly 30 billion
North of 3 billion from NT
From the domestic equity
And on the foreign equity investment
The primary purpose
Is to generate capital gain
To supplement the so forth
From the capital gain reduction
In domestic equity
And you asked about
Can Hanwei elaborate
On the SAA and the TAA's relations
Between how we treat
The exposures to equities
Yes, I think there's more
I mean the comments on
Between capital gains and dividends
Started helpful
But I mean in terms of risk control
And additional measures
For employees to lower the risk
Of suffering capital losses
I think what additional measures
Have you put in place
Now versus I think
Two or three years ago
Right, right
So let's talk about
The TAA and SAA first
And then we can describe
What's different
Okay
I think the last three years
I think we understand
The risk of equity
In the TAA and SAA setting
We are reducing exposure
Then we'll talk about more
And Anthony
What I observed is that
Our capital position
Our net worth
Is significantly higher
Than two years before
Every year
If you take a look at
Our presentation on page 17
You see that
The first nine months
Other comprehensive income
About less here
The whole year
9.2 billion
On the left-hand side
Similarly on page 17
You see that 2015
The net worth
Of our life insurance subsidiaries
Was only about 64.4
Today if you look at
The similar number
It is over 88
So supposedly we have more cushion
To solve the enlarged position
Time-wise as mentioned
We didn't actually increase exposure
What is now
If you see
We increased the local
Domestic exposures from 8.8%
To 10.2%
And in the Chinese section
We talked about the 11%
Of the TAAs upper limit
It doesn't mean
We were overly exposed
Ourselves to the beta
Now we focus 80%
For recurring yield
Beta for those
If we rely on
The RPCs calculations
Is only about a third
Compared to the others
Compared to the whole market
The beta of those
Are nearly about 0.3
To 0.4 only
Not one
Far away from
Far away from one
So if we have to talk about
The RPCs control
The VARs control I would say
Compared to two years before
Lesson has been learned
We are now having
A better discipline
Okay, thanks
Thank you
And next we'll have
Chong from Credit Suisse
For questions
Go ahead please
Hi guys
Chong from Credit Suisse again
Just two follow-up questions
I think do you have your
Equity per 40 years average beta now
That's my first question
Second question is
If I compare
Both on Q over Q
And E over E
I noticed
On your overseas fixed income
You lower foreign fixed income positions
But add to international bonds
I thought there's actually less
Issue and availability
Of international bonds
Just want to know
What's driving that change
Moving to the
International bond allocation
In terms of beta
Domestic equity is about 0.71
And overseas is about 1
Okay
And for the
Simply the availability
Of the bond offering
Changed that
And we are trying to move
As much as possible
From the real domestic fixed
Into the so-called
Promotion bond
Or the international bond
And we have increased
Roughly 100 billion
So far this year
And we'll continue to do so
But currently
The offering yield
Is somewhere around 4.1%
Which we refuse to take
So the speed of adding
That portfolio
Has not grown as fast
As it used to be
Right and Chong
We're not particularly
Worrying about slowdown of offering
Reason is because
From the summer of 2016
There was a deregulation
And since so we
Everyone do so
We increased exposure
To foreign assets
Through international bonds
That's because of the reallocation
Natural move we have to take
Now we only have to
Remain the level
At the certain amounts of
Exposure to overseas
Currently if we add on
Those numbers from
Foreign fixed incomes
International bonds
And the other equities or so
We have already
Had exposure as high as about 65%
Our view in the near future
Will be hardly being higher
As we still have to have
Exposure to domestic equities
Still have certain exposures
To local real estate
And the very high yielding policy law
There's no way that we're
Going to get rid of those
What is very important today
Is what we discussed before
We have to sell as much
As foreign policies as possible
Because more and more we expose
To foreign assets
The more and more we need
For those naturally
Hedge positions from the lab
I see
OK
This is one last
Question for me
How much more overseas
How much more to you
More overseas investments
You use Q3 as a base
I would say
Roughly 70%
Because as Sam said
We have property
We have mortgages
We have long policies
And we have domestic equity
And to a certain degree
We need to have some local currency
For payment as well
So I would say 70%
Will be the maximum
Internally
OK
Thank you
We are now in
Question and answer session
If you would like to ask a question
Please press 01
On your telephone keypad
Thank you
And the next question
Is from Thomas Wan
From Goldman Sachs
Go ahead please
Hi
Thank you for the presentation
And opportunity to ask
Just focus on investment again
On the dividend
You receive
10 billion this year
Do you have any target
For next year
Or sort of another angle
Are there any sort of special
One-off dividend
Within that 10 billion
Just once you are lower on that
And secondly
Is your investment assets
Still growing
Close to about 10% a year
With the new money coming in
Are you looking
On the equity side
Are you looking to allocate more
To the domestic
Are you still seeing
Opportunities there
Or are you more looking
Towards the foreign
Overseas equities
Thanks
Let me talk about
The first question first
And I'll let
During the process
For finalizing
At the point of now
I can really not give you
The detailed numbers
Right
Because it may change
What I know
And what I'm sure about
Is that next year
Given that we have
Growing assets
The overall cash that we receive
From domestic portfolios
Well
Very, very likely
Being higher than what we have
So year on year base
You will see a growing trend
Not necessarily means
We're relying more on the assets
But on the reasonable allocations
Is there any chunky
Dividend incomes
From any particular names
I would say those
High dividend yield segments
That you are quite familiar with
Some utilities
That helps a lot
I would say those are
All household names
Not
Got it
Moderator
Is there any new questions coming
Now as a reminder
Please press 01
On your telephone keypad
If you would like to ask a question
Thank you
Next we'll have
Anthony Lam from HSBC
For questions
Go ahead please
Just a few quick check
I think we haven't heard about
The recurring yield after hedging
For I think this nine months
Could you give us
I mean
The figure
And
You also mentioned
In the Chinese session
That for the nine months
Analyzed hedging costs
Were 1.61%
So if I calculated correctly
In third quarter only
That they imply
75 basis points
Analyzed hedging costs
I mean up to
This half of fourth quarter
What hedging costs are we seeing
And these are the two questions
For lifestyle
And a follow up on the banks
I think there
There is a special case
Of collateralized NPL
In the third quarter
Could you give us
A bit more color
As to which company
Or any timeline
To that solution
Thank you
Anthony let me talk about
Our this year's
After hedge yield
After hedging
Was about 3%
And last year
Slightly higher
About 3.29%
So this year we do suffer from
The high exchange rate volatility
We do
What is good now
And what is in line
With our expectations
And guidance
Is that
As early as the beginning
Of this year
We have seen
Annualized hedging costs
As 1.3 to 1.4%
And we guide the market
That it will not
Will not be as high
Our yearly target
Is 1.2 to 1.4%
Which is apparently
Lower than what we have today
So I foresee that
Not only the before hedging number
Will be higher than last year
But the
After hedging ones
If not higher than last year
Will not be significantly lower
Right
Will not be significantly lower
Compared to last year
Of course will be
Highly likely to be
Slightly lower
Can James talk about
The hedging
Hi
Our FX cost
Rose significantly
In the first quarter
But then it dwindled
To second and the third
And the fourth quarter
We pretty much paid the
Paid the cost of
NTF and CS only
So roughly
Each month we'll pay
About 1.1 billion NT
Just the cost of hedging
Because the NT dollar
Has not changed that much
And hovering at
Somewhere around
30.2%
So we're still targeting
At somewhere around 1.2%
Hedging cost for the entire year
And your last question
Is about the banks
Bad assets
Emerge in the third quarter
That one is from
The construction business
We're not worrying about it
Because it's fully collateralized
And we assume
We assume that
We can be fully covered
And the assets will be
We expect it to be
Before the end of the first half
OK, thank you
And just a quick follow-up
Has any provision
Been set up after that
Well we provision
Against that asset
According to how long
It has been there
Is according to the regulatory
OK, thank you
Provision is not high
And it shouldn't be high
Because we don't expect any loss
OK, thank you
